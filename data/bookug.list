title=Lessons Learned from Exploring the Backtracking Paradigm on the GPU
author=    John Jenkins,Isha Arkatkar,John D. Owens,Alok Choudhary,Nagiza F. Samatova
journal= European Conference on Parallel and Distributed Computing(Euro-Par)
year=2011
tags=Shared Memory,Connectivity Query,Memory Operation,Frequent Itemset Mining,Candidate Path,backtrack,Maximal Clique Enumeration(MCE), k-d tree(KD-tree)
star=***
problem=how to parallelize backtracking paradigm
interest=backtracking paradigm(depth-first search) is common in graph algorithms
hardness=backtracking paradigm is hard to parallelize
idea=store candidate paths in stack instead of backtracking, warp-level parallelism on GPU, work stealing, output buffering, coarse-grain parallelization where multiple subtrees are explored in parallel, utilize both CPU and GPU
future=improve the load balance on GPU
comment=A deep consideration of backtracking paradigm and depth-first search for graph algorithms,inability to provide better performance of MCE than CPU,four lessons are remarkable
other=breadth-first search is easier to be parallelized compared to depth-first search, but it consumes too much memory;combination is an idea and dividing into many blocks is another

title=GPU acceleration of subgraph isomorphism search in large scale graph
author=Bo Yang, Kai Lu, Yinghui Gao, Xiaoping Wang, Kai Xu
journal=Journal of Central South University
year=2015
tags=subgraph isomorphism, backtrack paradigm, GPU, parallel
star=*
problem=how to apply TurboISO to GPU
interest=TurboISO is a fast CPU subgraph isomorphism algorithm, is it suitable for GPU?
hardness=TurboISO adopts backtrack paradigm which is hard to be parallelized
idea=parallelism in different candidate region, the independency property of the partial subtree embedding allows that the GPU region exploration algorithm can first divide the region exploration into expanding and backtracking of partial subtree embeddings and then conquer the partial subtree embedding and generate new ones in parallel
future=
comment=the key of this paper is to adopts some BFS expanding strategies in the DFS framework, the shortcoming is that lots of DFS operations still exist and will limit the overall performance; if dfs work is too little, then the size of candidates will be too large for GPUto run(memory and thread limits), if dfs work is too much, then the time cost of dfs is too high, though the size of candidates for BFS is reduced
other=backtrack paradigm is rarely used in parallel computing

author=Coenraad Bron, Joep Kerbosch
journal=Commun. ACM
year=1973
tags=Graph Algorithm, Maximal Clique,Backtrack
star=****
problem=how to enumerate all maximal cliques in a graph
interest=widely used and its efficiency is very important in practice
hardness=A NP-hard problem
idea=use backtracking for search, with pruning strategies(pivot selection and vertex degeneracy ordering)
future=better pivot vertex selection, special optimization for special graphs
comment=classical and efficient work on maximal cliques enumeration,strict theoretical bound,work efficiently for many kinds of graphs including social network
other=different kinds of graphs have different kinds of optimizations; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bron%E2%80%93Kerbosch_algorithm#cite_note-1
