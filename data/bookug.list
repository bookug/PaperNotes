title=Lessons Learned from Exploring the Backtracking Paradigm on the GPU
author=    John Jenkins,Isha Arkatkar,John D. Owens,Alok Choudhary,Nagiza F. Samatova
journal= European Conference on Parallel and Distributed Computing(Euro-Par)
year=2011
tags=Shared Memory,Connectivity Query,Memory Operation,Frequent Itemset Mining,Candidate Path,backtrack,Maximal Clique Enumeration(MCE), k-d tree(KD-tree)
star=***
problem=how to parallelize backtracking paradigm
interest=backtracking paradigm(depth-first search) is common in graph algorithms
hardness=backtracking paradigm is hard to parallelize
idea=store candidate paths in stack instead of backtracking, warp-level parallelism on GPU, work stealing, output buffering, coarse-grain parallelization where multiple subtrees are explored in parallel, utilize both CPU and GPU
future=improve the load balance on GPU
comment=A deep consideration of backtracking paradigm and depth-first search for graph algorithms,inability to provide better performance of MCE than CPU,four lessons are remarkable
other=breadth-first search is easier to be parallelized compared to depth-first search, but it consumes too much memory;combination is an idea and dividing into many blocks is another

title=GPU acceleration of subgraph isomorphism search in large scale graph
author=Bo Yang, Kai Lu, Yinghui Gao, Xiaoping Wang, Kai Xu
journal=Journal of Central South University
year=2015
tags=subgraph isomorphism, backtrack paradigm, GPU, parallel
star=*
problem=how to apply TurboISO to GPU
interest=TurboISO is a fast CPU subgraph isomorphism algorithm, is it suitable for GPU?
hardness=TurboISO adopts backtrack paradigm which is hard to be parallelized
idea=parallelism in different candidate region, the independency property of the partial subtree embedding allows that the GPU region exploration algorithm can first divide the region exploration into expanding and backtracking of partial subtree embeddings and then conquer the partial subtree embedding and generate new ones in parallel
future=
comment=the key of this paper is to adopts some BFS expanding strategies in the DFS framework, the shortcoming is that lots of DFS operations still exist and will limit the overall performance; if dfs work is too little, then the size of candidates will be too large for GPUto run(memory and thread limits), if dfs work is too much, then the time cost of dfs is too high, though the size of candidates for BFS is reduced
other=backtrack paradigm is rarely used in parallel computing

year=2018
tags=Hypergraph, HyperX, graph framework, graph partitioning, label propagation partitioning
star=****
problem=support hypergraph computing
interest=not regular and hard to represent, but do occur in real case; Hypergraphs are generalizations of graphs where the (hyper)edges can connect any number of vertices. They are powerful tools for representing complex and non-pairwise relationship
hardness=existing graph computation frameworks cannot accommodate hypergraphs without converting them into graphs, because they do not offer APIs that support (hyper)edges directly. This graph conversion may create excessive replicas and result in very large graphs, causing difficulties in workload balancing 
idea=design a new optimization objective aimed to minimize the number of replicas and to achieve the balanced partitions, propose a novel label propagation algorithm to achieve the optimization running in parallel with several heuristics
future=open source HyperX and use it for other hypergraph processing tasks such as building similarity based regularization classifier for recommender systems and studying biochemical interactions.

idea=Workfront Sweep, Near-Far and Bucketing; to balance the tradeoff between saving work and organizational overhead
future=dynamic method that switches between Workfront Sweep and Near-Far(begin with a Workfront Sweep method until the vertex queue becomes large enough to saturate the GPU, Now that there is sufficient parallelism, we would switch to our Near-Far Pile technique where work efficiency is more important. Finally, after most of the graph has been explored, and we return to a lack of sufficient parallelism, we would switch back again to Workfront Sweep to finish off the problem, similar to [id=36]);  lack of available parallelism on road network (low-degree graphs), combine our work-saving method with a PHAST-like pre- processing step to identify more vertices from which to start our SSSP sweeps

Dynamic arrays are poorly suited to the current programming model of GPUs, and implementing a custom memory management system for dynamic arrays (utilizing heaps) would be difficult and inefficient;  fine-grained renaming and moving vertices between buckets is difficult to paral lelize, likely requiring atomics and thus losing concurrency; efficient GPU implementations require exploiting three-layer memory hierarchy(global DRAM, per-block shared memory, and per-thread registers) of GPU
