problem=SimRank is a similarity measure for graph nodes that has numerous applications in practice.
interest=Scalable SimRank computation has been the subject of extensive research for more than a decade, and yet, none of the existing solutions can efficiently derive SimRank scores on large graphs with provable accuracy guarantees.
hardness=the state-of-the-art solution requires up to a few seconds to compute a SimRank score in million-node graphs, and does not offer any worst-case assurance in terms of the query error.
idea=This paper presents SLING, an efficient index structure for SimRank computation. SLING guarantees that each SimRank score returned has at most ε additive error, and it answers any singlepair and single-source SimRank queries in O(1/ε) and O(n/ε) time, respectively. These time complexities are near-optimal, and are significantly better than the asymptotic bounds of the most recent approach.
