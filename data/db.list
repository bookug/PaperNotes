title=SLING: A Near-Optimal Index Structure for SimRank
author=Boyu Tian, Xiaokui Xiao
journal=SIGMOD
year=2016
tags=SimRank via Local Updates and Sampling (SLING), Near-Optimal index Structure, SimRank score, theorectical bound, similarity measure, provable accuracy guarantees, computation complexity, analysis of existing methods
star=****
problem=SimRank is a similarity measure for graph nodes that has numerous applications in practice.
interest=Scalable SimRank computation has been the subject of extensive research for more than a decade, and yet, none of the existing solutions can efficiently derive SimRank scores on large graphs with provable accuracy guarantees.
hardness=the state-of-the-art solution requires up to a few seconds to compute a SimRank score in million-node graphs, and does not offer any worst-case assurance in terms of the query error.
idea=This paper presents SLING, an efficient index structure for SimRank computation. SLING guarantees that each SimRank score returned has at most ε additive error, and it answers any singlepair and single-source SimRank queries in O(1/ε) and O(n/ε) time, respectively. These time complexities are near-optimal, and are significantly better than the asymptotic bounds of the most recent approach.

title=Real-time Event Detection on Social Data Streams 
author= Mateusz Fedoryszak, Brent Frederick, Vijay Rajaram, Changtao Zhong
journal=sigkdd
year=2019
tags=data mining, social network, Real-time event Detection, social data stream, snapshot (computer storage), profiling, modular design, cluster analysis, Real-time system, trending events
star=****
problem=The information that is generated on social platforms like Twitter can produce rich data streams for immediate insights into ongoing matters and the conversations around them. 
interest=Social networks are quickly becoming the primary medium for discussing what is happening around real-world events.
hardness=To tackle the problem of event detection, we model events as a list of clusters of trending entities over time.
idea=We describe a real-time system for discovering events that is modular in design and novel in scale and speed: it applies clustering on a large stream with millions of entities per minute and produces a dynamically updated set of events.
future=
comment= In order to assess clustering methodologies, we build an evaluation dataset derived from a snapshot of the full Twitter Firehose and propose novel metrics for measuring clustering quality. Through experiments and system profiling, we highlight key results from the offline and online pipelines. Finally, we visualize a high profile event on Twitter to show the importance of modeling the evolution of events, especially those detected from social data streams.

title=AtSNE: Efficient and Robust Visualization on GPU through Hierarchical Optimization

journal=sigkdd

tags=data mining, Anchor-t-SNE (AtSNE), Visualization, GPU, Hierarchical Optimization, high memory, cluster, AI, machine learning, data point, high-dimensional data, similarity, anchor point
star=****
problem=Visualization of high-dimensional data is a fundamental yet challenging problem in data mining. 
interest=These visualization techniques are commonly used to reveal the patterns in the high-dimensional data, such as clusters and the similarity among clusters.
hardness=Recently, some successful visualization tools (e.g., BHt-SNE and LargeVis) have been developed. However, there are two limitations with them : (1) they cannot capture the global data structure well. Thus, their visualization results are sensitive to initialization, which may cause confusions to the data analysis. (2) They cannot scale to large-scale datasets. They are not suitable to be implemented on the GPU platform because their complex algorithm logic, high memory cost, and random memory access mode will lead to low hardware utilization.
idea=To address the aforementioned problems, we propose a novel visualization approach named as Anchor-t-SNE (AtSNE), which provides efficient GPU-based visualization solution for large-scale and high-dimensional data. Specifically, we generate a number of anchor points from the original data and regard them as the skeleton of the layout, which holds the global structure information. We propose a hierarchical optimization approach to optimize the positions of the anchor points and ordinary data points in the layout simultaneously.
future=
comment=Our approach presents much better and robust visual effects on 11 public datasets, and achieve 5 to 28 times speed-up on different datasets, compared with the current state-of-the-art methods. In particular, we deliver a high-quality 2-D layout for a 20 million and 96-dimension dataset within 5 hours, while the current methods fail to give results due to running out of the memory.

title=A Memory-Efficient Sketch Method for Estimating High Similarities in Streaming Sets  (MaxLogHash)

star=****
problem=Estimating set similarity and detecting highly similar sets are fundamental problems in areas such as databases, machine learning, and information retrieval. 
interest=MinHash is a well-known technique for approximating Jaccard similarity of sets and has been successfully used for many applications such as similarity search and large scale learning. Its two compressed versions, b-bit MinHash and Odd Sketch, can significantly reduce the memory usage of the original MinHash method, especially for estimating high similarities (i.e., similarities around 1). 
hardness=Although MinHash can be applied to static sets as well as streaming sets, of which elements are given in a streaming fashion and cardinality is unknown or even infinite, unfortunately, b-bit MinHash and Odd Sketch fail to deal with streaming data. 
idea= To solve this problem, we design a memory efficient sketch method, MaxLogHash, to accurately estimate Jaccard similarities in streaming sets. Compared to MinHash, our method uses smaller sized registers (each register consists of less than 7 bits) to build a compact sketch for each set. We also provide a simple yet accurate estimator for inferring Jaccard similarity from MaxLogHash sketches. In addition, we derive formulas for bounding the estimation error and determine the smallest necessary memory usage (i.e., the number of registers used for a MaxLogHash sketch) for the desired accuracy. 
future=
comment=We conduct experiments on a variety of datasets, and experimental results show that our method MaxLogHash is about 5 times more memory efficient than MinHash with the same accuracy and computational cost for estimating high similarities.

star=****
problem=Given a large, semi-infinite collection of co-evolving data sequences (e.g., IoT/sensor streams), which contains multiple distinct dynamic time-series patterns, our aim is to incrementally monitor current dynamic patterns and forecast future behavior. 
interest=
hardness=
idea=We present an intuitive model, namely OrbitMap, which provides a good summary of time-series evolution in streams. We also propose a scalable and effective algorithm for fitting and forecasting time-series data streams. Our method is designed as a dynamic, interactive and flexible system, and is based on latent non-linear differential equations.
future=
comment=Our proposed method has the following advantages: (a) It is effective: it captures important time-evolving patterns in data streams and enables real-time, long-range forecasting; (b) It is general: our model is general and practical and can be applied to various types of time-evolving data streams; (c) It is scalable: our algorithm does not depend on data size, and thus is applicable to very large sequences. Extensive experiments on real datasets demonstrate that OrbitMap makes long-range forecasts, and consistently outperforms the best existing state-of-the-art methods as regards accuracy and execution speed.
