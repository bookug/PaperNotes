title=Relational Joins on Graphics Processors
author=Bingsheng He,Ke Yang,Rui Fang,Mian Lu,Naga K. Govindaraju,Qiong Luo,Pedro V. Sander
journal=ACM Conference on Management of Data(SIGMOD)
year=2008
tags=relational database,join,sort,primitive,parallel processing,graphics processors(GPU),lock-free scheme for result output(three phase),data-parallel primitive,nested-loop,sort-merge,hash join
star=****
problem=how relational joins can utilize hardware features of the GPU
interest=relational join is the most time-consuming part in query processing
hardness=the relational join algorithms must be optimized to adapt to the features of new-generation GPU
idea=contsructing primitives providing high-level abstractions for data-centric operations and are highly tuned to fully utilize the architectural features of graphics processors, combine quick sort(lower work complexity, when the whole amount of work is larger than cores) and bitonic sort(lower step complexity, only when placed in shared memory)
future=evaluate the join algorithms in this paper with more complex workloads,to schedule the execution of relational query processing between CPU and GPU so that their computation power is fully exploited
comment=the first job to apply relational join algorithms(non-indexed nested loop join, indexed nested loop join, sort-merge join, hash join) on GPGPU, and in experiments only quad-CPUs are compared; in split primitive each thread maintains a local histogram, which limits the number of partitions(larger number requires multiple passes of split); better to quantitatively study the performance impact of each individual hardware feature
other=the first to do something will always be remembered, even he does not so well; far behind the CPU vendors' tradition of giving sufficient details about the hardware specification

other=observe the features of some algorithms on a mainstream data(i.e. powerlow) and propose some optimizations corresponding to it

tags=GPU,RDF,SPARQL,Subgraph Matching,Gunrock,filtering-and-joining
star=*
problem=how to implement subgraph matching on GPU based on the Gunrock framework

hardness=how to use this operators and how to improve the performance
idea=collect candidates for vertices and edges respectively, then enumerate all combinations of the candidates of all query edges
future=joining order selection and reducing intermediate results
comment=the filtering strategy is too simple,the process of collect edge candidates may be very slow due to higher work complexity causing by long neighbor lists,the number of enumeration is too large for GPU to run,the locking strategy for result ouput can be very slow if many final results exist
other=this work can not deliver better performance than [id=12] paper, though it claims to

title=Fast Subgraph Matching on Large Graphs using Graphics Processors
author=Ha-Nguyen Tran,Jung-jae Kim,Bingsheng He
journal=International Conference on Database Systems(DASFAA, CCF B conference in Database area)
year=2015
tags=GPU-friendly,filtering-and-verification,Subgraph Matching
star=****
problem=how to implement a GPU-frinedly subgraph matching algorithm
interest=subgraph matching problem is complex and hard and frequently encounted in real life,leverage the parallelism power of GPU in graph algorithms
hardness=traditional subgraph matching algorithms are based on backtracking strategies, so hard to be run in parallel;too complicate and too many cases
idea=use filtering-and-verification framework,two-step output scheme from [id=10],efficient GPU techniques of coalescence, warp-based and shared memory utilization, and a recursive refinement function for pruning irrelevant candidate vertices
future=improve the efficiency of GpSM for large graphs, for example, by dealing with large amount of intermediate results that do not fit into the GPU memory and also by adopting buffering techniques
comment=its strategy for very large graphs is too simple and may not work,only utilize a few of the shared memory,target at undirected graphs without edge labels;using a warp for a row, threads may be wasted if the work of a row divide by 32 and only get a small remaining,the load imbalance still exists if the work of a row is too large and should be dealed by a block(or many blocks) first; generates a large amount of irrelevant candidate vertices and edges, thus the size of intermediate table is very large
other=the definition used here is based on embedding subgraphs rather than induced subgraphs;the paper extends GpSM for very large graphs by retrieving only relevant vertices and their adjacency lists to the GPU memory

comment=为了验证算法的精度，需要用比较快的方法得到一个图的独立数的上界，请问如何证明附录中相应算法的正确性，以及衡量该算法得到的上界和独立数相比的误差？关于论文中贪婪算法预处理的复杂度，只是需要按度数排序而已，不可以对邻接表另外建个索引，用他们的坐标（而非整个链表）参与排序，又因为所有顶点在内存中是可以放下的，这样不是可以保证开销很低？如果能有较快的方法得到独立数非常紧的界，甚至得到精确的独立数的值，MIS的复杂度可能得到实质性的改善么？
