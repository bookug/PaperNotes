title=gStore: Answering SPARQL queries via subgraph matching
author=Lei Zou, Jinghui Mo, Lei Chen, M. Tamer Ozsu, Dongyan Zhao
journal=Proceedings of the Vldb Endowment(CCF A of Database area)
year=2011
tags=RDF, SPARQL Queries, Subgraph Matching, S-Tree, VS*-tree
star=****
problem=store and query RDF data via subgraph matching
interest=RDF has been used in various applications. For example, Yago, DBPedia & Bio2RDF
hardness=query processing & wildcard queries & scalability & Subgraph matching is a NP-hard problem & storage problem
idea=graph-based approach,translate a SPARQL query to a query graph. VS*-tree(like B+ tree, good for disk storage), searching strategy like DFS 
future=not mentioned
comment=A detailed paper. VS*-tree is its main contribution, but too costly in practice and its filtering efficiency may be not good due to or operation(too many 1s in the top level nodes)

title=Natural language question answering over RDF: a graph data driven approach
author=Lei Zou，Ruizhe Huang，Haixun Wang，Jeffrey Xu Yu，Wenqiang He，Dongyan Zhao
journal=ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data
year=2014
tags=NLP(Natural Language Processing), RDF, QA, Graph,SPARQL
star=****
problem=Answer a natural language problem via RDF Q/A system
interest= We need a easy interface for users to use Q/A system, how to answer more precisely
hardness= Natural language has ambiguation
idea= rudece NPL to subgraph matching query and then evaluate it. If passed, search the transformed SPARQL query in the database, graph structure can reserve the structure of main components of a natural sentence
future=NULL
comment=Subgraph matching is a NP-hard question, time complexity may become a challenge. Use subgraph matching to understand natural language is a new point, reduce the NLp problem to SPARQL query is also hard and the precision is hard to compete with Deep Learning(better at tuning)

title=Subgraph matching: on compression and computation.
author=Miao Qiao, Hao Zhang and Hong Cheng
journal= Proceedings of the Vldb Endowment(CCF A of database area)
year=2017
tags=VCBC(vertex-cover based compression), CBF, helve, Crystal and clique , C(x,y)
star=****
problem=Find the set of all the subgraphs that are iosmorphic to the pattern graph.
interest=various appliactions such as biology ,social science ,et al.
hardness=It is NP hard & target graph may not fit into the memory & output crisis
idea=using output compression（vector-cover based）, Crystal-based Computation Framework to reduce the cost of subgraph matching. Combine both to 'Core-Crysstal Decomposition'& introduce CBF to external momory and parallel platforms
future=explore the compression technique on directed or labeled grapgs
comment=a minimun vertex cover is still preferred & the definition of 'helve' cannot be found outside

title=An analytical study of large SPARQL query logs
author=Angela Bonifati, Wim Martens, and Thomas Timm
journal=Proceedings of the Vldb Endowment
year=2017
tags= Analytical study, topology of queries, CQ( conjuctive queries), workload, RDF, SPARQL
star=****
problem=some features among SPARQL query logs
interest= Query logs can indicate the actual usage of data, indicating how to optimize based on workload
hardness= projection makes the evalutaion hard(so ignore it)
idea=mine the projection in Queries, analyse the shape/structure of queries(chain faster than cycle), Sort the graph into two classes: graph and hyper-graph & the introduction of streak
future= more refined analysis on the encountered streaks& evaluation of streaks of larger scale
comment= It's a statistics analyzing essay. Simple queries (one triple) are the majority. Some kinds of queries (CQ , CQ^F, CQ^OF,etc) have some advantages which can reduce computation and they also take a large percentage, cycle is not common, tree width, A  large  fraction  of  these  property  paths  are  extremely simple
other= NoSQL is inherently a workload-based optimization for Database, adapting to various scenes; many datasets and benchmarks are used in this paper, which can be borrowed
