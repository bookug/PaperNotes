title=gStore: Answering SPARQL queries via subgraph matching
author=Lei Zou, Jinghui Mo, Lei Chen, M. Tamer Ozsu, Dongyan Zhao
journal=Proceedings of the Vldb Endowment(CCF A of Database area)
year=2011
tags=RDF, SPARQL Queries, Subgraph Matching, S-Tree, VS*-tree
star=****
problem=store and query RDF data via subgraph matching
interest=RDF has been used in various applications. For example, Yago, DBPedia & Bio2RDF
hardness=query processing & wildcard queries & scalability & Subgraph matching is a NP-hard problem & storage problem
idea=graph-based approach,translate a SPARQL query to a query graph. VS*-tree(like B+ tree, good for disk storage), searching strategy like DFS 
future=not mentioned
comment=A detailed paper. VS*-tree is its main contribution, but too costly in practice and its filtering efficiency may be not good due to or operation(too many 1s in the top level nodes)
other= use coding idea in [id:326] of bookug.list; tags each vertex with a signature and matches signatures of data vertices and query vertices one by one using the VS*-tree index

title=Natural language question answering over RDF: a graph data driven approach (ganswer)
author=Lei Zou，Ruizhe Huang，Haixun Wang，Jeffrey Xu Yu，Wenqiang He，Dongyan Zhao
journal=ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data
year=2014
tags=NLP(Natural Language Processing), RDF, QA, Graph,SPARQL, Subgraph matching, gstore, ganswer
star=****
problem=Answer a natural language problem via RDF Q/A system
interest= We need a easy interface for users to use Q/A system, how to answer more precisely
hardness= Natural language has ambiguation
idea=rudece NPL to subgraph matching query and then evaluate it. If passed, search the transformed SPARQL query in the database, graph structure can reserve the structure of main components of a natural sentence; resolve the ambiguity of natural language questions at the time when matches of query are found. The cost of disambiguation is saved if there are no matching found.
future=NULL
comment=Subgraph matching is a NP-hard question, time complexity may become a challenge. Use subgraph matching to understand natural language is a new point, reduce the NLp problem to SPARQL query is also hard and the precision is hard to compete with Deep Learning(better at tuning)
other=an imporved version of [id:12]

title=Subgraph matching: on compression and computation.
author=Miao Qiao, Hao Zhang and Hong Cheng
journal= Proceedings of the Vldb Endowment(CCF A of database area)
year=2017
tags=VCBC(vertex-cover based compression), CBF, helve, Crystal and clique , C(x,y)
star=****
problem=when the system has to materialize the subgraph isomorphism results as a preprocessing/intermediate/final result or an index, the cost of the exporting dominates the overall cost
interest=various appliactions such as biology ,social science ,et al.
hardness=It is NP hard & target graph may not fit into the memory & output crisis
idea=using output compression（vector-cover based）, Crystal-based Computation Framework to reduce the cost of subgraph matching. Combine both to 'Core-Crysstal Decomposition'& introduce CBF to external momory and parallel platforms
future=explore the compression technique on directed or labeled grapgs
comment=a minimun vertex cover is still preferred & the definition of 'helve' cannot be found outside

title=An analytical study of large SPARQL query logs
author=Angela Bonifati, Wim Martens, and Thomas Timm
journal=Proceedings of the Vldb Endowment
year=2017
tags= Analytical study, topology of queries, CQ( conjuctive queries), workload, RDF, SPARQL
star=****
problem=some features among SPARQL query logs
interest= Query logs can indicate the actual usage of data, indicating how to optimize based on workload
hardness= projection makes the evalutaion hard(so ignore it)
idea=mine the projection in Queries, analyse the shape/structure of queries(chain faster than cycle), Sort the graph into two classes: graph and hyper-graph & the introduction of streak
future= more refined analysis on the encountered streaks& evaluation of streaks of larger scale
comment= It's a statistics analyzing essay. Simple queries (one triple) are the majority. Some kinds of queries (CQ , CQ^F, CQ^OF,etc) have some advantages which can reduce computation and they also take a large percentage, cycle is not common, tree width, A  large  fraction  of  these  property  paths  are  extremely simple
other= NoSQL is inherently a workload-based optimization for Database, adapting to various scenes; many datasets and benchmarks are used in this paper, which can be borrowed

year=2004
tags=R-MAT, rmat, Recursive Model, Graph Mining, power-law Distribution, unimodal distribution, Erdos-Renyi model, AutoMAT-fast, subcommunity,cross-community links
star=***
problem=How does a `normal' computer (or social) network look like?  How can we spot `abnormal' sub-networks in the Internet, or web graph?
interest=The answer to such questions is vital for outlier detection (terrorist networks, or illegal money-laundering rings), forecasting, and simulations (\how will a computer virus spread?")")
hardness=
idea=The heart of the problem is finding the properties of real graphs that seem to persist over multiple disciplines. We list such "laws" and, more importantly, we propose a simple, parsimonious model, the "recursive matrix" (R-MAT) model, which can quickly generate realistic graphs, capturing the essence of each graph in only a few parameters.
future=
comment=Contrary to existing generators, our model can trivially generate weighted, directed and bipartite graphs; it subsumes the celebrated Erdos-Renyi model as a special case; it can match the power law behaviors, as well as the deviations from them (like the "winner does not take it all" model of Pennock et al. [id:15], also unimodal distribution). We present results on multiple, large real graphs, where we show that our parameter fitting algorithm (AutoMAT-fast) ts them very well.
other=the rate of power-law distribution is decided by |V|,|E|,a,b,c,d    ;  Boost Graph Library provides the implementation  https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_54_0/libs/graph_parallel/doc/html/rmat_generator.html
