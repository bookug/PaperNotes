title=gStore: Answering SPARQL queries via subgraph matching
author=Lei Zou, Jinghui Mo, Lei Chen, M. Tamer Ozsu, Dongyan Zhao
journal=Proceedings of the Vldb Endowment(CCF A of Database area)
year=2011
tags=RDF, SPARQL Queries, Subgraph Matching, S-Tree, VS*-tree
star=****
problem=store and query RDF data via subgraph matching
interest=RDF has been used in various applications. For example, Yago, DBPedia & Bio2RDF
hardness=query processing & wildcard queries & scalability & Subgraph matching is a NP-hard problem & storage problem
idea=graph-based approach,translate a SPARQL query to a query graph. VS*-tree(like B+ tree, good for disk storage), searching strategy like DFS 
future=not mentioned
comment=A detailed paper. VS*-tree is its main contribution, but too costly in practice and its filtering efficiency may be not good due to or operation(too many 1s in the top level nodes)
other= use coding idea in [id:326] of bookug.list; tags each vertex with a signature and matches signatures of data vertices and query vertices one by one using the VS*-tree index

title=Natural language question answering over RDF: a graph data driven approach (ganswer)
author=Lei Zou，Ruizhe Huang，Haixun Wang，Jeffrey Xu Yu，Wenqiang He，Dongyan Zhao
journal=ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data
year=2014
tags=NLP(Natural Language Processing), RDF, QA, Graph,SPARQL, Subgraph matching, gstore, ganswer
star=****
problem=Answer a natural language problem via RDF Q/A system
interest= We need a easy interface for users to use Q/A system, how to answer more precisely
hardness= Natural language has ambiguation
idea=rudece NPL to subgraph matching query and then evaluate it. If passed, search the transformed SPARQL query in the database, graph structure can reserve the structure of main components of a natural sentence; resolve the ambiguity of natural language questions at the time when matches of query are found. The cost of disambiguation is saved if there are no matching found.
future=NULL
comment=Subgraph matching is a NP-hard question, time complexity may become a challenge. Use subgraph matching to understand natural language is a new point, reduce the NLp problem to SPARQL query is also hard and the precision is hard to compete with Deep Learning(better at tuning)

title=Subgraph matching: on compression and computation.
author=Miao Qiao, Hao Zhang and Hong Cheng
journal= Proceedings of the Vldb Endowment(CCF A of database area)
year=2017
tags=VCBC(vertex-cover based compression), CBF, helve, Crystal and clique , C(x,y)
star=****
problem=when the system has to materialize the subgraph isomorphism results as a preprocessing/intermediate/final result or an index, the cost of the exporting dominates the overall cost
interest=various appliactions such as biology ,social science ,et al.
hardness=It is NP hard & target graph may not fit into the memory & output crisis
idea=using output compression（vector-cover based）, Crystal-based Computation Framework to reduce the cost of subgraph matching. Combine both to 'Core-Crysstal Decomposition'& introduce CBF to external momory and parallel platforms
future=explore the compression technique on directed or labeled grapgs

star=****
problem=some features among SPARQL query logs
interest= Query logs can indicate the actual usage of data, indicating how to optimize based on workload
hardness= projection makes the evalutaion hard(so ignore it)
idea=mine the projection in Queries, analyse the shape/structure of queries(chain faster than cycle), Sort the graph into two classes: graph and hyper-graph & the introduction of streak
future= more refined analysis on the encountered streaks& evaluation of streaks of larger scale
comment= It's a statistics analyzing essay. Simple queries (one triple) are the majority. Some kinds of queries (CQ , CQ^F, CQ^OF,etc) have some advantages which can reduce computation and they also take a large percentage, cycle is not common, tree width, A  large  fraction  of  these  property  paths  are  extremely simple
other= NoSQL is inherently a workload-based optimization for Database, adapting to various scenes; many datasets and benchmarks are used in this paper, which can be borrowed

star=***
problem=How does a `normal' computer (or social) network look like?  How can we spot `abnormal' sub-networks in the Internet, or web graph?
interest=The answer to such questions is vital for outlier detection (terrorist networks, or illegal money-laundering rings), forecasting, and simulations (\how will a computer virus spread?")")
hardness=
idea=The heart of the problem is finding the properties of real graphs that seem to persist over multiple disciplines. We list such "laws" and, more importantly, we propose a simple, parsimonious model, the "recursive matrix" (R-MAT) model, which can quickly generate realistic graphs, capturing the essence of each graph in only a few parameters.
future=
comment=Contrary to existing generators, our model can trivially generate weighted, directed and bipartite graphs; it subsumes the celebrated Erdos-Renyi model as a special case; it can match the power law behaviors, as well as the deviations from them (like the "winner does not take it all" model of Pennock et al. [id:15], also unimodal distribution). We present results on multiple, large real graphs, where we show that our parameter fitting algorithm (AutoMAT-fast) ts them very well.
other=the rate of power-law distribution is decided by |V|,|E|,a,b,c,d    ;  Boost Graph Library provides the implementation  https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_54_0/libs/graph_parallel/doc/html/rmat_generator.html

interest=Database queries can be broadly classified into two categories: reporting queries and aggregation queries. The former retrieves a collection of records from the database that match the query's conditions, while the latter returns an aggregate, such as count, sum, average, or max (min), of a particular attribute of these records. Aggregation queries are especially useful in business intelligence and data analysis applications where users are interested not in the actual records, but some statistics of them.

star=***
problem=Vertex-centric and edge-centric paradigms are widely used to design graph analytics accelerators. 
interest=Hardware accelerators for graph analytics have gained increasing interest.
hardness=vertex-centric paradigm requires random memory accesses to traverse edges and edge-centric paradigm results in redundant edge traversals.
idea=we explore the tradeoffs between vertex-centric and edge-centric paradigms and propose a hybrid algorithm which dynamically selects between them during the execution. We introduce the notion of active vertex ratio, based on which we develop a simple but efficient paradigm selection approach. We develop a hybrid data structure to concurrently support vertex-centric and edge-centric paradigms. Based on the hybrid data structure, we propose a graph partitioning scheme to increase parallelism and enable efficient parallel computation on heterogeneous platforms.

problem=
interest=The single-instruction multiple-thread (SIMT) programming model was introduced and popularized for graphics processor units (GPUs) along with the introduction of CUDA
hardness=A deadlock-free program on a multiple-instruction multiple-data (MIMD) architecture may deadlock on a SIMT machine
idea=we propose a static analysis technique that detects SIMT deadlocks by inspecting the application control flow graph (CFG). We further propose a CFG transformation that avoids SIMT deadlocks when synchronization is local to a function. Both the analysis and the transformation algorithms are implemented as LLVM compiler passes. Finally, we propose an adaptive hardware reconvergence mechanism that supports MIMD synchronization without changing the application CFG, but which can leverage our compiler analysis to gain efficiency.
future=
comment=The static detection has a false detection rate of only 4%–5%. The automated transformation has an average performance overhead of 8.2%–10.9% compared to manual transformation.  Our hardware approach performs on par with the compiler transformation, however, it avoids synchronization scope limitations, static instruction and register overheads, and debuggability challenges that are present in the compiler only solution.
