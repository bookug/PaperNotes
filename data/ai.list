title=GraphRNN: Generating Realistic Graphs with Deep Auto-regressive Models
author=Jiayuan You
journal=ICML
year=2018

star=****
problem=
interest=
hardness=
idea=a deep autoregressive model that addresses the above challenges and approximates any distribution of graphs with minimal assumptions about their structure. GraphRNN learns to generate graphs by training on a representative set of graphs and decomposes the graph generation process into a sequence of node and edge formations, conditioned on the graph structure generated so far
