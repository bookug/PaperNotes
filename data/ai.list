title=GraphRNN: Generating Realistic Graphs with Deep Auto-regressive Models
author=Jiayuan You
journal=ICML

star=****
problem=

hardness=
idea=a deep autoregressive model that addresses the above challenges and approximates any distribution of graphs with minimal assumptions about their structure. GraphRNN learns to generate graphs by training on a representative set of graphs and decomposes the graph generation process into a sequence of node and edge formations, conditioned on the graph structure generated so far

title=Multi-Turn Response Selection for Chatbots with Deep Attention Matching Network
author=xiangyang zhou, Lu Li
journal=Proceedings of the 56th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Long Papers)  (ACL)
year=2018
tags=response Selection, chatbot, depp Attention matching network, dialogue
star=****
problem=investigate matching a response with its multi-turn context using dependency information based entirely on attention.
interest=Human generates responses relying on semantic and functional dependencies, including coreference relation, among dialogue elements and their context.
hardness=
idea=construct representations of text segments at different granularities solely with stacked self-attention; extract the truly matched segment pairs with attention across the context and response
