An embedded DSL exists as a library in the host language (Scala in our case), leading to seamless integration.

Additional details can be found in our technical report [70].  (on arXiv)

aiming to alleviate the computational burden while preserving a good performance


Graphs are ubiquitous nowadays and have a wide range of applications in bioinformatics, chemistry, recommender systems, social network study, program static analysis, etc. Among these, one of the fundamental problems is to retrieve a set of similar graphs from a database given a user query.

Finding the most appropriate cost function is a major research issue in itself and outside the scope of this paper.

The proliferation of high throughput, dynamic graphstructured data raises challenges for traditional graph data management techniques.

we verify answers from SJ-tree posteriorly with the timing order constraints.

Thus, we propose a simple yet effective heuristic rule.
