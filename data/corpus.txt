aiming to alleviate the computational burden while preserving a good performance


Graphs are ubiquitous nowadays and have a wide range of applications in bioinformatics, chemistry, recommender systems, social network study, program static analysis, etc. Among these, one of the fundamental problems is to retrieve a set of similar graphs from a database given a user query.
