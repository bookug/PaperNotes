problem=The central algorithmic problem for Petri nets is reachability: whether from the given initial conguration there exists a sequence of valid execution steps that reaches the given nal conguration.  The complexity of the problem has remained unsettled since the 1960s, and it is one of the most prominent open questions in the theory of verication

title=The Parallel Repetition of Non-signaling Games: Counterexamples and Dichotomy 
author= Justin Holmgren, Lisa Yang
journal=STOC
year=2019
tags=quantum computing, parallel Repetition, Non-signaling game, Counterexamples, Dichotomy
star=****
problem=Non-signaling games are an important object of study in the theory of computation, for their role both in quantum information and in (classical) cryptography. In this work, we study the behavior of these games under parallel repetition.
interest=
hardness=
idea=unlike the situation both for classical games and for two-player non-signaling games, there are k-player non-signaling games (for k  3) whose values do not tend to 0 with sucient parallel repetition. In fact, parallel repetition sometimes does not decrease their value whatsoever.  ;     We show that in general: 1. Every game's non-signaling value under parallel repetition is either lower bounded by a positive constant or decreases exponentially with the number of repetitions.  2. Exponential decrease occurs if and only if the game's sub-non-signaling value (Lancien and Winter, CJTCS '16) is less than 1.

tags=quantum computing, quantum Singular value Transformation, Exponential Improvement, quantum Matrix Arithmetics, optimal Hamiltonian simulation
star=****
problem=
interest=Quantum computing is powerful because unitary operators describing the time-evolution of a quantum system have exponential size in terms of the number of qubits present in the system.
hardness=
idea=We develop a new ‚ÄúSingular value transformation‚Äù algorithm capable of harnessing this exponential advantage, that can apply polynomial transformations to the singular values of a block of a unitary, generalizing the optimal Hamiltonian simulation results of Low and Chuang [LC17a]. The proposed quantum circuits have a very simple structure, often give rise to optimal algorithms and have appealing constant factors, while typically only use a constant number of ancilla qubits.

other=graph canonization is the problem finding a canonical form of a given graph G. A canonical form is a labeled graph Canon(G) that is isomorphic to G, such that every graph that is isomorphic to G has the same canonical form as G. Thus, from a solution to the graph canonization problem, one could also solve the problem of graph isomorphism: to test whether two graphs G and H are isomorphic, compute their canonical forms Canon(G) and Canon(H), and test whether these two canonical forms are identical.      Graph canonization is the essence of many graph isomorphism algorithms. One of the leading tools is Nauty (http://pallini.di.uniroma1.it/#ftn.id001)

star=****
problem=Under the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis, an integer linear program with n Booleanvalued variables and m equations cannot be solved in c^n time for any constant c < 2.
interest=If the domain of the variables is relaxed to [0,1], the associated linear program can of course be solved in polynomial time.
hardness=
idea=we give a natural algorithmic bridging between these extremes of 0-1 and linear programming. Specically, for any subset (finite union of intervals) E  in [0,1] containing {0,1}, we give a random-walk based algorithm with runtime O_{E}((2-measure(E))^n poly(n,m)) that finds a solution in E^n to any n-variable linear program with m constraints that is feasible over {0,1}^n. Note that as E expands from {0,1} to [0,1], the runtime improves smoothly from 2^n to polynomial.  Taking E as [0,1/k) union (1-1/k,1] in our result yields as a corollary a randomized (2-2/k)^n poly(n) time algorithm for k-SAT.

star=****
problem= If you ask a quantum computer to perform a computation for you, how can you know whether it has really followed your instructions, or even done anything quantum at all?
interest=Researchers had already shown that a verifier can check a quantum computer if the verifier is capable of measuring quantum bits. A classical verifier lacks this capability, by definition. But what if the classical verifier could somehow force the quantum computer to perform the measurements itself and report them honestly?
hardness=many of the problems a quantum computer could solve do not have this feature. In other words, a classical computer not only cannot solve them, but cannot even recognize whether a proposed solution is correct.   (except number factoring, which is easy to verify)
idea=The tricky part, Mahadev realized, would be to get the quantum computer to commit to which state it was going to measure before it knew which kind of measurement the verifier would ask for ‚Äî otherwise, it would be easy for the computer to fool the verifier. That‚Äôs where the secret-state method comes into play: Mahadev‚Äôs protocol requires the quantum computer to first create a secret state and then entangle it with the state it is supposed to measure. Only then does the computer find out what kind of measurement to perform.
