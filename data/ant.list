title=DSSLP: A Distributed Framework for Semi-supervised Link Prediction

journal=arXiv, Accepted by BigData as Industry paper

problem=Link prediction is widely used in a variety of industrial applications, such as merchant recommendation, fraudulent transaction detection, and so on.
interest=
hardness=However, it’s a great challenge to train and deploy a link prediction model on industrial-scale graphs with billions of nodes and edges.
idea=a scalable and distributed framework for semi-supervised link prediction problem (named DSSLP), which is able to handle industrial-scale graphs. Instead of training model on the whole graph, DSSLP is proposed to train on the k-hops neighborhood of nodes in a mini-batch setting, which helps reduce the scale of the input graph and distribute the training procedure. In order to generate negative examples effectively, DSSLP contains a distributed batched runtime sampling module. It implements uniform and dynamic sampling approaches, and is able to adaptively construct positive and negative examples to guide the training process. Moreover, DSSLP proposes a model-split strategy to accelerate the speed of inference process of the link prediction task.

future=
comment=much better than BERT. graph is used for improving word embedding here.
other=In graph (user-user), how about inegrating multimodal data (image, voice, etc.) as user feature, to improve graph tasks?
