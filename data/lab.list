title=Triangle counting on GPU using fine-grained task distribution(TC)
author=Lin Hu, Naiqing Guan, Lei Zou
journal=ICDE workshop
year=2019
tags=GPU, triangle counting(TC), fine-grained
star=***
problem=Due to the irregularity of graph data, designing an efficient GPU-based graph algorithm is always a challenging task
interest=
hardness=Inefficient memory access and work imbalance often limit GPU-based graph computing, even though GPU provides a massively parallelism computing fashion
idea= a fine-grained task distribution strategy for triangle counting task
future=
comment= good at dealing with graphs with over 100M edges, and it achieves 2x-7x faster than state-of-art methods on large graphs.
other=oriented from a competition of CCF

idea=Different from existing feature-based approaches, we map all edges into a two-dimensional space R^2 and propose a bitmap structure to index R^2.
