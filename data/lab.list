title=Triangle counting on GPU using fine-grained task distribution(TC)
author=Lin Hu, Naiqing Guan, Lei Zou
journal=ICDE workshop
year=2019
tags=GPU, triangle counting(TC), fine-grained
star=***
problem=Due to the irregularity of graph data, designing an efficient GPU-based graph algorithm is always a challenging task
interest=
hardness=Inefficient memory access and work imbalance often limit GPU-based graph computing, even though GPU provides a massively parallelism computing fashion
idea= a fine-grained task distribution strategy for triangle counting task
future=
comment= good at dealing with graphs with over 100M edges, and it achieves 2x-7x faster than state-of-art methods on large graphs.
other=oriented from a competition of CCF

title=ProbeSim: Scalable Single-Source and Top-k SimRank Computations on Dynamic Graphs
author=Yu Liu, Bolong Zheng, Zhewei Wei(corresponding author), Jiaheng Lu
journal=VLDB
year=2018
tags=ProbeSim, single-source and top-k SimRank, dynamic graphs
star=****
problem=single-source and Top-k SimRank
interest=Single-source and top-k SimRank queries are two important types of similarity search in graphs with numerous applications in web mining, social network analysis, spam detection, etc
hardness=A plethora of techniques have been proposed for these two types of queries, but very few can efficiently support similarity search over large dynamic graphs, due to either significant preprocessing time or large space overheads.
idea=ProbeSim, an index-free algorithm for single-source and top-k SimRank queries that provides a nontrivial theoretical guarantee in the absolute error of query results.  ProbeSim estimates SimRank similarities without precomputing any indexing structures, and thus can naturally support real-time SimRank queries on dynamic graphs. Besides the theoretical guarantee, ProbeSim also offers satisfying practical efficiency and effectiveness due to non-trivial optimizations
